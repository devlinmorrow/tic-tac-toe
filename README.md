# tic-tac-toe

Command-Line Tic Tac Toe game written in Clojure.

###Installation Instructions

1. Prerequisites: [Clojure](https://clojure.org/community/downloads), 
[JDK 8](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/install/install_overview.html)
 and [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org/).

2. Clone this repo.  

3. `lein run` to run the program and `lein spec` to run the tests.

### Issues

1. The board is currently hardcoded as 3x3 and should be abstracted so that any 
board dimensions work.

### Wishlist

1. Abstracting the board methods and adding the ability to indicate to the program
what board size is desired.

2. Unbeatable computer player mode.
